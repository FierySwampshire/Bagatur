# Overview

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/Engines">Engines</a> project contains the configurations of Bagatur engine as well as
some experiments with the evaluation functions of different java chess engines like CuckooChess, Carballo and Chess22k.
The idea is to compare the evaluation functions of these engines with the evaluation function of Bagatur and here are the conclusions:
 - The evaluation function of CuckooChess is 100 ELO weaker than the evaluation of Bagatur.
 - The evaluation function of Carballo is 40 ELO weaker than the evaluation of Bagatur.
 - The evaluation function of Chess22k is 100 ELO stronger than the evaluation of Bagatur. Currently Bagatur is using this evaluation function.
