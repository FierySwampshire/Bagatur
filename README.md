# Overview

Bagatur chess engine is one of the strongest Java chess engines in the world.
It is also available for android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessartforkids">Chess Art For Kids</a> game, which has its own user interface (demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOrsN8fCr7Q">video1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XDen8vLtc">video2</a>).

# Downloads

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur-Chess-Engine-And-Tools/tree/master/Downloads/Engine">latest release</a> runs under all Operating Systems, which support Java platform.

# Sources

The <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur-Chess-Engine-And-Tools/tree/master/Sources">source code</a> is writen entirely in Java programming language.

# ELO Rating

The <a href="http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Bagatur">ELO rating</a> is an important metric for a chess engine.

# Machine Learning experiments

There are some code examples of experiments with the <a href="http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/">neuroph</a>-2.94 library.
The starting point is located <a href="https://github.com/bagaturchess/Bagatur/tree/master/Sources/LearningImpl/src/bagaturchess/deeplearning/run">here</a>.
Although the ELO strength is with 50 ELO less than the version with manually tuned parameters, the results are successful meaning that the neural network's backpropagation algorithm works as expected.
This makes the experiments a good showcase of <a href="http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/">neuroph</a> library.
