The program runs under all Operating Systems, which support Java platform:
* **Windows**, there are *.exe files for direct run. Here are the steps necessary to run the engine:
  * Download an arbitrary UCI user interface. For example the most popular one is <a href="http://www.playwitharena.com/">Arena</a>.
  * Install the UCI user interface on your computer.
  * Ensure that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or later is installed on your computer (it should be the case nowadays but if not, have in mind that JRE is required, only JDK doesn't work).
  * Unpack this distribution somewhere (Arena has a sub-folder called 'engines', you can extract it there).
  * Open the UCI user interface and register the engine inside (You should become familiar with the installed UCI user interface anyway). You may use win32 or win64 version depending on your choice.
  * E2-E4 and enjoy :-)
* **Linux**, there are *.bat files for giving idea how to write bash scrip for running
* **Android**, there is a program called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessartforkids&hl=en">Chess Art For Kids</a> with own user interface (GUI) and using Bagatur internally as a chess engine
